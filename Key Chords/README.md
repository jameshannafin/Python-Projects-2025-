#Key Chords

I created the key chord engine because I love to create music; but I have not had the expereince of learning  the formation and mixture of key chords.

This application lets the user select a 'key' for the melodody and then select any number and variation of recogognized harmonic chords to create a melody that should flow no matter what!



The midi files can than be replayed in the the program dragged into a Digital Audio Workstation to be further used and edited!
